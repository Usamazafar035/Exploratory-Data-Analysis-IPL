# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-IPL

🚀 Unveiling Insights from IPL 2008-2019 with Power BI! 🏏

I'm excited to present this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) dashboard, developed as part of my Spark Foundation internship. This project covers key metrics from the Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons between 2008 and 2019, including:

🏆 Title Winners
🏏 Highest Run Scorers
🎯 Highest Wicket Takers
💥 Total Sixes and Fours

The dashboard also provides insights into match wins based on toss decisions and a detailed breakdown of runs conceded by bowlers across all seasons.

This project involved tackling challenges in data transformation and cleaning, utilizing calculated columns and calculated measures to derive meaningful insights. It was a rewarding experience, demonstrating the importance of accurate data handling and showcasing the capabilities of Power BI in data visualization.
